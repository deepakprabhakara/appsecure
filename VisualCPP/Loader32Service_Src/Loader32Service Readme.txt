This is the automated Loader32 port - this will work in the background and run the protected application if the card is inserted. It chooses the first reader on the list if multiple readers are attached, please try to keep it to only one reader while testing.

This program is meant for those moments when you do not really want to harass the user with geeky dialog boxes8-).

If any error occurs, the program simply quits.
